# üßæ Airbnb Backend User Stories

## üìò Objective
This document translates the key **use cases** from the Airbnb Use Case Diagram into **user stories**.  
Each user story describes a core interaction between an actor (Guest, Host, or Admin) and the Airbnb backend system.  
These stories help guide backend feature development by focusing on real user goals and motivations.

## üß† Notes
- Each user story corresponds to a **use case** from the UML diagram.  
- These stories can later be broken down into **technical tasks** or **API endpoints** during implementation.  
- The goal is to ensure the system is user-centered and focused on real-world needs.

‚úÖ **Next Step:**  
Use these user stories as a foundation for:
- Creating **API design specifications**
- Writing **acceptance criteria**
- Planning **sprint or feature backlog**
